## Project Description

This project is a ML approach to detect credit card transaction fraud.

It is important that credit card companies have the ability to **recognize fraudulent credit card transactions**  to avoid financial loss and also to avoid regular transactions from being blocked due to wrong classification problem which can cause stress and embarassment for the clients. 

Considering the financial loss can be minimized, investments in AI for fraud detection have been growing in the past few years.

The main goal is to improve **Machine Learning** algorithms based on the large volume of historical data available. The smallest improvement can represent saving a large amount of money.



## Results

The entire process is detailed and coded in the notebooks: [PT](https://github.com/marinavillaschi/creditcard-fraud-detection/blob/main/Detecção_de_transações_fraudulentas_em_cartõ__es_de_crédito.ipynb) or [EN](https://github.com/marinavillaschi/creditcard-fraud-detection/blob/main/Credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb)

Also, a blog post of the findings is available [here](https://pandascouple.medium.com/detec%C3%A7%C3%A3o-de-transa%C3%A7%C3%B5es-fraudulentas-em-cart%C3%B5es-de-cr%C3%A9dito-41b386b32f01).
